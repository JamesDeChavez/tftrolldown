# TFT Roll Down Traing Tool

## Introduction
TFT Roll Down is a training tool I created to help practice the "roll-down" mechanic for the video game Teamfight Tactics. Players can customize the game options to practice specific game scenarios and then review the post-game log to analyze their results and find areas of improvement.
